## CSS Slider

A slider using CSS.  Two shortcomings are the lack of marking which photo in the series is displayed when the page is loaded (If you click the link below you will note I added the hash ```#photo1``` to get around this.  And also the lack of transition for the first photo; there did not seem any CSS selector which would accomplish this; In javascript this would be straightforward.

This was done for The Odin Project. I decided to go the CSS route to level up a bit in CSS.  I borrowed from a sitepoint blog, How to create a CSS3 only tab control using the :target selector.  But I still learned alot about CSS since I had to adapt his CSS to my HTML structure.

Here is [the slider](https://theghall.github.io/odin-css-slider/#photo1)
